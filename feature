#Branching#
breaching is helpful when you want to add new features to a project without changing the main source of code. 
The work done on different branches will not show up on the main branch until you merge it,
You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to main.

When you create a branch off the main branch, you're making a copy of main as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the main branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

The journey that feature takes through stages for "Commit changes," "Submit pull request," and "Discuss proposed changes" before it's merged into main
